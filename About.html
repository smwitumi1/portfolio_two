        <p>I am a successful Kenyan serial entrepreneur with a diverse background in customer service, marketing, commercial law, forensic science, criminology, legal writing, and ICT law. I've showcased strong leadership, research, and training skills in founding and managing two companies. In 2018, I co-founded Fundis, connecting users to skilled artisans. In 2021, I launched Chuuza, a mobile platform linking users to professional local service providers. Through Chuuza, my aim is to empower excluded young women for financial freedom. I hold a Bachelor of Arts in Security Management and Criminology, along with a qualification in legal studies, contributing to my business success. I've earned accolades like the 2019 Global Student Entrepreneurship (GSEA) winner and the 2020 Challenge of 1000 Laurette winner, with two-time Africarena semi-finalist recognition. Committed to empowering young women and creating job opportunities, I'm excited to lead efforts in transforming work within the African informal sector using technology enablers.</p>
